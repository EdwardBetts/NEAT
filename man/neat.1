.SH NAME
neat \- nebular empirical analysis tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
neat [option1] [value1] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
neat carries out a comprehensive empirical analysis on a list of nebular emission line fluxes. If uncertainties are required, it evaluates them using a Monte Carlo approach.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input [FILENAME]
Input file. The file should be in plain text, and can have two, three or four columns. Two columns are assumed to be rest wavelength and flux, three are assumed to be rest wavelength, flux and uncertainty, and four columns are assumed to be observed wavelength, rest wavelength, flux and uncertainty.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-uncertainties
Calculate uncertainties, using 20,000 iterations.  If this option is specified, the \-n option will be ignored
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-n\-iterations [VALUE]
Number of iterations. Default: 1
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-extinction\-law [VALUE]
Extinction law to use for dereddening.

Valid values are:
 \fBHow\fR: Galactic law of Howarth (1983, MNRAS, 203, 301)
 \fBCCM\fR: Galactic law of Cardelli, Clayton, Mathis (1989, ApJ, 345, 245)
 \fBFitz\fR: Galactic law of Fitzpatrick & Massa (1990, ApJS, 72, 163)
 \fBLMC\fR: LMC law of Howarth (1983, MNRAS, 203, 301)
 \fBSMC\fR: SMC law of Prevot et al. (984, A&A, 132, 389)
Default: How
.TP
.B \-c [VALUE]
The logarithmic extinction at H beta.  By default, this is calculated from the Balmer line ratios.
.TP
.B \-nelow, \-nemed, \-nehigh, \-telow, \-temed, \-tehigh [VALUE]
By default, electron densities and temperatures are calculated from the available diagnostics, but their values can be overridden with these commands.  The required units are cm\-3 for densities and K for temperatures.
.TP
.B \-he, \-\-helium\-data [VALUE]
The atomic data to use for He I abundances

Valid values are:
 \fBS96\fR: Smits, 1996, MNRAS, 278, 683
 \fBP12\fR: Porter et al., 2012, MNRAS, 425, 28
Default: S96
.TP
.B \-icf, \-\-ionisation\-correction\-scheme [VALUE]
The ICF scheme to be used to correct for unseen ions

Valid values are:
 \fBKB94\fR: Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994, MNRAS, 271, 257)
 \fBPT92\fR: Peimbert, Torres\-Peimbert & Ruiz (1992, RMxAA, 24, 155)
 \fBDI14\fR: Delgado\-Inglada, Morisset & Stasinska (2014, MNRAS, 440, 536)
Default: KB94
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbosity [VALUE]
Amount of output to write for each derived quantity. This option has no effect unless \-n or \-u is specified.

Valid values are:
 1: write out summary files, binned results and complete results
 2: write out summary files and binned results
 3: write out summary files only
Default: 3
.TP
.B \-id, \-\-identify
This option triggers an algorithm which attempts to convert observed wavelengths into rest wavelengths. If the option is not present, NEAT assumes that the input line list already has rest wavelengths in the first column
.TP
.B \-norp
When calculating Monte Carlo uncertainties, NEAT's default behaviour is to compensate for the upward bias affecting weak lines described by Rola and Pelat (1994). This option overrides that and no compensation is calculated.
