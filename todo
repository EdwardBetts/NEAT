1. improve the reading of line list.  should do the following:

  - check for 2, 3 or 4 columns.
    - 2 columns = rest wavelength + flux, no uncertainty
    - 3 columns = rest wavelength + flux + uncertainty
    - 4 columns = obs, rest, flux, uncertainty
  - read and identify before the loop
  - identify blends and treat them sensibly, eg 7320/7330, use blended line wavelength

2. include atomic data in output table
3. use configuration files to determine which diagnostics will be used and which multiplets included in OII and NII abundances

bug investigations

1. check ashkbiz run, why does it report an O ORL abundance and why do some ICFs end up inf?  
2. get all data types consistent, avoid real=4 <--> real=8 conversions
