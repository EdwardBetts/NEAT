deblending:
1. compile list of blended lines
2. check isolated lines of same element, subtract flux from blend
3. start with He, then OII, then CIII

1. improve the reading of line list.  should do the following:
  - read and identify before the loop
  - put them into arrays, or add ID to a structure?
  - identify blends and treat them sensibly, eg 7320/7330, use blended line wavelength

2. line finder, try fitting a 5th order polynomial or something instead of a simple linear shift

3. regression testing
     - checkout every commit
     - compile
     - run on ngc 6543 line list
     - get time of run and results

4. more examples, with UV and IR lines, high and low excitation

5. find out why sii T diagnostic gives FPE on debug3. happens in subroutine CFY, input value seems to be undefined somehow
