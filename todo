deblending:
1. compile list of blended lines
2. check isolated lines of same element, subtract flux from blend
3. start with He, then OII, then CIII

1. improve the reading of line list.  should do the following:
  - read and identify before the loop
  - put them into arrays, or add ID to a structure?
  - identify blends and treat them sensibly, eg 7320/7330, use blended line wavelength

2. line finder, try fitting a 5th order polynomial or something instead of a simple linear shift

3. replace current ILs, H, He, etc routines with simpler and clearer line assignment using pointers:
      set linelist as target
      define H, He, ILs, etc as pointers
      define arrays of wavelengths, to set up the pointer arrays
      do all this before loop, then can operate equivalently on the whole linelist array for eg dereddening, or parts for eg ne(Balmer)
