1. read in all lines, fluxes, uncertainties
2. call routines to identify them
3. put them into arrays, or just add ID to a structure?
4. analyse
5. add atomic data to output files


1. improve the reading of line list.  should do the following:

  - check for 2, 3 or 4 columns.
    - 2 columns = rest wavelength + flux, no uncertainty
    - 3 columns = rest wavelength + flux + uncertainty
    - 4 columns = obs, rest, flux, uncertainty
  - read and identify before the loop
  - identify blends and treat them sensibly, eg 7320/7330, use blended line wavelength

2. line finder, try fitting a 5th order polynomial or something instead of a simple linear shift

3. include atomic data in output table
4. use configuration files to determine which diagnostics will be used and which multiplets included in OII and NII abundances

0. line identification outside loop - 
1. line list tables should not include abundances, put them in separate tables
3. remove RLs way outside optical which will be of no use for a very long time

bug investigations

1. check ashkbiz run, why does it report an O ORL abundance and why do some ICFs end up inf?  
2. get all data types consistent, avoid real=4 <--> real=8 conversions
